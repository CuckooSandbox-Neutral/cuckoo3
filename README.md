I'll write it as it is. Progress is being made and there are more and more options for delivering malicious payloads.
I donâ€™t want to see how paid sunboxes from different companies have a lot of bugs and fix them at the wrong time and use open source parts in their wrapper and sell for millions. 
It should be free!

Restoring the Cuckoo project is a personal goal, at the end of which.
I want every virus analyst (or virus creator) not to worry that his computer will live someone else's life.
