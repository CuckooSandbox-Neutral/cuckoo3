# Supported machinery modules
This page lists all currently supported virtualization/machinery modules and the required steps for each of them.

!!! note "Note"
    Required Python packages must always be installed in the same virtualenv as Cuckoo.

### Configuring a chosen module

Cuckoo must be told what machinery modules to use. The chosen module(s) can be configured in `$USER/.cuckoocwd/conf/cuckoo.yaml` under the `machineries` list.
Values in this list must always be lowercase.

```yaml
# A YAML list of all machinery modules that should be enabled and Cuckoo will be using. Machines for
# each of the modules specified here have to be configured in their respective configuration file
# in the conf/machineries directory. It is only possible to run multiple machinery modules if their underlying
# virtualization layers do not interfere with each other.
# Example:
#
# machineries:
#   - machinery1
#   - machinery2
machineries:
- qemu
```

#### Change tcpdump path binary
```yaml
# Settings used by Cuckoo to find the tcpdump binary to use for network capture of machine traffic.
tcpdump:
  enabled: True
  path: /usr/bin/tcpdump #Path to tcpdump
```

### Modules

All supported machinery modules are listed below


#### QEMU (TYPE 1)

QEMU is currently de default machinery module. Machines for it can be created with VMCloak. 
The minimum QEMU version is 2.11.

QEMU machine start arguments are read from a JSON file that contains a list of string arguments (devices, network args, etc).

Arguments that cannot be used are: `-incoming` `-monitor` `-qmp` `-loadvm` `-no-shutdown` `-qmp-pretty` `-snapshot`.

Example:

```json
{
  "machine": {
      "start_args": [
          "-thing", "value"
      ]
  }
}
```

Cuckoo assumes that interfaces/bridges of the QEMU machines are already up/will somehow be created. Cuckoo does not assign or 
create any network interfaces. Help on how interfaces can autoamtically be created can be found on [the QEMU wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/HelperNetworking){target=_blank}.

###### QEMU memory snapshot

Cuckoo uses migration to restore machine to a running state. It does not use disk snapshots. See [this page](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Migration){target=_blank} for help on how to create these.

###### QEMU disks

Cuckoo assumes QEMU disks are qcow2 and are created with the `lazy_refcounts=on,cluster_size=2M` options. Cuckoo creates a new disk with those options and
the configured machine disk as the backing disk.

###### Required system packages 
- `qemu-system` (In Ubuntu 22.04)
- `qemu-utils`

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-system qemu-utils
```


#### KVM libvirt (TYPE 2)
KVM is supported by Cuckoo. Cuckoo speaks to KVM using [Libvirt](https://libvirt.org/docs.html){target=_blank}.

###### Required system packages
- `qemu-kvm`
- `libvirt-daemon` 
- `bridge-utils`
- `virt-manager` 
- `virtinst`

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon bridge-utils virt-manager virtinst
```

###### Required Python packages
- `libvirt-python`

```bash
pip install libvirt-python
```
